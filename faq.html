                    <p>How fast can you check your e-mail? Just kidding, when you sign up for an account, you will get an e-mail message with your activation link in it. Click the activation link to confirm your account sign-up and away you go. We do it this way to ensure that real people with real e-mail accounts are signing up.</p>

                    <p>Hello. This is Money Manager Team.
                        Thank you very much for using our website.

                        We are very sorry for your inconvenience.
                        Unfortunately, we don’t support the sync feature you said.
                        The goal is to provide services within the first half of this year,
                        However, that function requires new security feature and a large system, therefore, We apologize
                        for the difficulty in giving you an accurate schedule.

                        We will do our best to make it better.</p>
